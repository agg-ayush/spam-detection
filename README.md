A general-purpose spam detection system to distinguish between legitimate (ham) and spam content using machine learning.

## ðŸ“œ Description

This project implements a machine learning model to classify content as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). It can be adapted for various applications, including email filtering, comment moderation, and message screening. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing and feature extraction. The primary goal is to build an effective and adaptable spam filter.

## âœ¨ Features

-   **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and prepares text data for modeling.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzes the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of spam vs. ham content.
-   **Feature Engineering:** Creates new features from the text data, such as character, word, and sentence counts, to improve model performance.
-   **Model Training:** Builds and trains a classification model to predict whether a piece of content is spam or not.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset

This project can be trained on any labeled spam/ham dataset. A common starting point is the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, but it can easily be replaced with other datasets for emails, comments, or other text-based content. The dataset should ideally be in a CSV format with two columns: one for the label (`ham` or `spam`) and one for the raw text content.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need the following libraries:

-   NumPy
-   Pandas
-   scikit-learn
-   NLTK
-   Matplotlib

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/agg/spam-detection.git
    cd spam-detection
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
    ```

3.  **Download the NLTK data:**
    Run the following command in a Python interpreter:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    ```

### Usage

1.  Place your dataset file (e.g., `spam_dataset.csv`) in the root directory of the project.
2.  Update the file path in the notebook to load your dataset.
3.  Open the `spam-detection.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
4.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to see the data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and evaluation.
